# Blockchain 101

### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is as a _Collection_ or a  _Set_ of multiple blocks that contains information/data.
Depending on the blockchain, they can only store Transactions(Value) or Transactions and Data (Value and Smart Contracts).

It can be explained as a decentralized ledger and all the information that is store on it,
has an immutables status, meaning that all information, once confirmed by the protocol, becomes unchangeable.

### Where comes the Security?

The security of a blockchain is created by the sum of the __Miners/Validators__ of the same network.

There are many _types/consensus_ of Blockchains, and each one has his own features, for example:

- __Proof-of-Work__
  - Bitcoin, Ergo,...
  - The block validation and token issuances are created by the __Miners__.
- __Proof-of-Stake__
  -  Cardano, ...
  - The block validation and token issuances are created by the __Node Validators__.
-  __Pure Proof-of-Stake__
    - Algorand, ...
- The block validation and token issuances are created by the __Holders Validators__.
- __Proof-Of-History__
  - Solana, ...
- The block validation and token issuances are created by the __Time Validators__.
- __Proof-Of-Space__
  - Chia, ...
- The block validation and token issuances are created by the __Storage Validators__.
- and many more...

Given Proof-of-Work(PoW) as example, the more Miners a network has, the more secure it is because if bad actors want to take advantage
 of the network (to be able to cancelled others transactions, double-spending tokens...), they have to had more than 51% to be able to attack it.

### Blocks

We defined Blockchain as being a _Collection_ of _Blocks_, so lets find out what's inside a block.

Blocks have many characteristics for example:

-  __Value__ - Native Token (BTC, ERG, ADA, ...)
- __Data__ - timestamp, block height,...
- __Smart Contracts__ - NFT's for example
    - only if the blockchain allows it. 
    - The Bitcoin for example does not support natively Smart Contracts)
- and so on...

### Quiz
<details> 
<summary> <strong>Pop Quiz: &nbsp;Can Ergo be considered a decentralized legder? </strong> </summary>
&emsp;<underline>Yes!</underline> <br>
&emsp;Ergo is based on Blockchain technology which inherits all characteristics like decentralized ledger.<br>
