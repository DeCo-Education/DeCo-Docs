# Blockchain 101

```text title="Completion Status"
Version: 1st Version
Question from Kii: I think this is an interesting part of development. Because it is generic yet it is somehow important. The question we should ask ourselves is not if we're actually have the right information for what Blockchain is, because there are other resources out there that can provide way better information as compared to what we can provide. The question to ourselves is, what information should be put into this article that can really benefit the students who are here to learn about Ergo dApp development.
```

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain can be seen as an immutable ledger that has the history of all transactions that ever existed on that blockchain. These transactions are completed in **Blocks**.

Depending on the blockchain, they can store Value (Bitcoin network) or Value and data that allows it to conduct smart transactions (Ergo, Ethereum, Cardano), whereby smart transactions are transactions that are given rules and therefore can only be executed in certain manners.

It can be viewed as a decentralized ledger where all the information that is stored on it, are immutables, meaning that all information, once confirmed by the protocol, becomes unchangeable.

## What is a Block?

A block can be defined as a group of transactions, where generally multiple transactions at a single point in time are stored together thus forming one block.

In Ergo the first block is called 'Genesis' and each block is created with approximately 2 minutes interval between.

```mermaid
graph LR
Block0[Block 'Genesis'] -->|2 min| Block1[Block Nº1]
Block1 -->|2 min| Block2[Block Nº2]
Block2 -->|2 min| Block3[Block Nº3]
Block3 -->|2 min| Block4[Block Nº...]
```

## What is an Address?

An eUTXO address is a container where one or more **boxes** are stored, that can hold value or data.

The address can be considered as a reference for all your boxes on the network and to access it, you must provide a valid combination of Public and Private keys.

```mermaid
graph TD
Address[Address] --> box1[box 1]
Address[Address] --> box2[box 2]
Address[Address] --> box3[box 3]
Address[Address] --> box4[box ...]
```

---
## What is a Box?

A box is a simple container for Value and Data. 
Each Blockchain have different sections and criteria for the box creation but the most common are:

- Value
  - Section in which the transaction value is stored in its native form 
- Data
  - Section in which the transaction data is stored in form of a **Smart Contract**

Natively, Bitcoin only allow to store Value while Ergo allows to store Value and Data.

```mermaid
graph LR
BTC[Bitcoin Box] -->|can store| Value([Value])    
ERG[Ergo Box] --> |can store| Value([Value])
ERG[Ergo Box] --> |can store| Data([Data])
Data --> SmartContracts([Smart Contracts])
```

---
## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is an on-chain code that upon a successful validation, is executed on the blockchain creating a smart **transaction**.

In Ergo a smart contract is also called a Guard Script.

---
## What is a Transaction(Tx)?
A transaction(TX for short) is when an exchange of Value/Data occurs, in this case, on a decentralized ledger.

In the eUTXO model, a transaction need to have **Input** and will always have an **Output**.

When a TX is successfully added to a block:
  - The Input is considered as "spent boxes".
  - The Output is considered as "unspent boxes".

To be a valid transaction, along with the Guard Script validation, it must follow the most basic rule: "the sum of the Input must be equal to the sum of the Output".

In Ergo, the minimum for a transaction to be successful is 0,001 ERG.

Then the transaction is added to the current network block and then a block to be successfully added to the full blockchain needs to be correctly **validated/secured** by the Network Miners.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Unspent ->>Spent Box: after a successful transaction, the box become spent
```

---
## Where comes the Validation/Security?

There are many Blockchains _consensus_ and each one has its own features but the most common are PoS and PoW.

The block validation is taken care different if:
- is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) the validation is taken care by Node validators/operators.
- is Proof-of-Work (PoW) the validation is taken care by Miners. 

Ergo is a Proof-of-Work(PoW) blockchain where Miners are an important part to maintain the security of the network.
By security what is meant is that Miners provide Hardware (GPU's) that calculates long mathematical problems to ensure the correct continuity of chain.

Is with this consensus that the blockchain remains secure without bad actors modifying blocks at own will.

<summary> <strong>&nbsp;Can Ergo be considered a decentralized ledger? </strong> </summary>
&emsp; Yes! <br>
&emsp; Ergo is based on Blockchain technology which inherits all characteristics like decentralized ledger.

<br>
<details> 
<summary> <strong>&nbsp;What type of boxes are created after a TX? </strong> </summary>
&emsp; Ergo creates two types of boxes: <br>
&emsp;&emsp; The "unspent boxes" and the "spent boxes"

## Conclusion
Blockchain is a decentralized and immutable ledger that stores all the transactions history. 

Has features like:
1. Decentralized
2. Secure
3. Transparent
4. Immutable

And allows to:
1. Be used as currency
2. Be a store of value
3. Create multiple projects on top of this features

```text title="Cabin Sessions"
Throughout this article, we discussed about what is Blockchain technology. Ask each Cabin Members about
1. What they understand Blockchain
2. Describe Blocks in their own words
3. What kind of application can be or already has being implemented via Blockchain
4. Discuss members opinions and give one exemple too. Blockchain is used for tracking token prices like "Ergo Oracle pools" 
```

In the next topic we will discuss more about __What is Ergo?__
