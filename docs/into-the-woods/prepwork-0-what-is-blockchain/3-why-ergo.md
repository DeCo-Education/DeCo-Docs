# Why Ergo

As a developer, there are several reasons why you should consider using Ergo as your blockchain platform of choice:

## 1. Ergo's Advanced Scripting Language

Ergo's scripting language, called ErgoScript, is more advanced than Bitcoin's Script language and is Turing-complete. This means that developers have more flexibility to create complex smart contracts and dApps on Ergo. ErgoScript also supports a wide range of cryptographic primitives, making it possible to create secure and privacy-preserving applications.

## 2. Ergo's Efficiency

Ergo uses a novel consensus algorithm, Autolykos, which is more energy-efficient than traditional proof-of-work algorithms. This means that it's more environmentally friendly, and also less expensive to run nodes on the network. Additionally, Ergo's advanced scripting language allows for more efficient use of blockchain resources, such as memory and computation, resulting in lower fees and faster transaction times.

## 3. Ergo's Flexibility

Ergo's non-fungible token (NFT) standard, known as the Ergo Token (ERG), is compatible with the popular ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. This means that developers can easily integrate existing NFTs and DeFi applications into the Ergo ecosystem, while also creating new NFTs and DeFi applications specific to Ergo.

## 4. Ergo's Focus on Security

Ergo places a strong emphasis on security, with features such as the Sigma Protocol and advanced cryptographic primitives. This makes Ergo a more secure platform for developers to build on, and also more attractive to users who value privacy and security in their blockchain applications.

## 5. Ergo's Active Community

Ergo has a growing and active community of developers, contributors, and supporters. The platform is open-source, and contributions are welcomed from anyone who is interested in building on Ergo. This means that there are plenty of resources and support available for developers who choose to build on Ergo.

### Incentives for Developers to Build on Ergo

In addition to the technical advantages of using Ergo, there are also several incentives for developers to build on the platform:

Ergo offers low fees, making it an affordable platform for developers to experiment with and build on.
Ergo has a strong focus on privacy and security, which is increasingly important to users and businesses alike.
Ergo's NFT standard allows for the creation and exchange of unique digital assets, which can be valuable for developers creating digital collectibles, gaming applications, and other unique applications.
Ergo's focus on energy efficiency and sustainability aligns with the growing trend of environmentally-friendly blockchain technologies.
Integration with the Wider Blockchain Ecosystem
Ergo is designed to be compatible with existing blockchain technologies and standards, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means that developers can easily integrate Ergo into their existing blockchain solutions or create new solutions that bridge different blockchain ecosystems.

Additionally, Ergo's focus on security and privacy makes it a valuable platform for creating solutions that address pressing issues, such as supply chain management, digital identity, and secure data sharing. By building on Ergo, developers can leverage its advanced features to create more secure and efficient solutions that are in line with the values and needs of modern businesses and users.

Overall, Ergo is a powerful blockchain platform that offers a range of advantages and incentives for developers who are looking to build innovative blockchain solutions. Its advanced scripting language, efficiency, flexibility, security, and active community make it a strong contender in the world of blockchain technology.

That being said, it's time to get **Juicy** and start diving into Developing on Ergo!
